# Led Blink
## Description
  I used a breadboard, a Metro Express board, an led, and a couple wires with a 220 ohm risistor to wire up the circuit, and run the code to make the led blink. ISN"T THAT COOL?!! This is was our first assignment of the year with circuitpython. At first it seemed to be a little difficult than I thougth, but once I actually started working on it, it felt good. I used [this](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-metro-m4-express-featuring-atsamd51/creating-and-editing-code) website to get a little help with the code.

### Code
```C
import board
import digitalio
import time

led = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.D13)
led.direction = digitalio.Direction.OUTPUT

while True:
    led.value = True
    time.sleep(0.5)
    led.value = False
    time.sleep(0.5)
```

### Reflection 
I learned a lot of new things by doing this assignment. First of all, pushing the work from local device to github account is just getting easier and smoother. I learned some basic knowledge of how the circuitpython looks. I learned how to code a metro express to make an led blink.
